# notifications-for-sporting-events
This project is designed for users to have easy access to notable sporting events as soon as they happen. A user can tailor their notifications to the sports/players of their choice. Some options for tailored categories will be: NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, etc.

Once a user has subscribed to a particular category, they will receive notifications via the app's interface for notable events within that category. See `examples` for what notifications will look like on the user end. 

# examples

```bash
