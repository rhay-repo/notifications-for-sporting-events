Once a user has subscribed to a particular category, they will receive notifications via the app's interface for notable events within that category. See below for examples of what notifications will look like on the user end. (THESE EXAMPLES NEED TO BE CHANGED)

NBA notifications:
```bash
NBA: Luka Doncic (Mavericks) recorded his 44th career triple double against the 76ers.
Final: 107-98 Mavericks
Feb 4th, 2022
```
MLB notifications:
```bash
MLB: Tyler Gilbert (Diamondbacks) threw a no-hitter against the Indians.
Final: 3-0 Brewers
Sept 11th, 2021
```
